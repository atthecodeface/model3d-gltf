/// GLTF notes
///
/// A GLTF file contains zero, one or more Scenes. If it has zero scenes
/// then it is a 'library' of meshes or whatever; this is supported here.
///
/// Each scene consists of an array of *root* nodes (that is, nodes thare
/// are never the children of other nodes). The same node may appear in
/// more than one scene.
///
/// The GLTF file contains an array of nodes, but they actually form a set
/// of node hierarchies. Each hierarchy has a single root and no cycles.
/// Each node is part of a single hierarchy. The hierarchy is indicated by
/// each parent node listing its children nodes by Gltf file node array
/// index.
///
/// A node may have a transformation associated with it; if it does, then
/// everything 'inside' the node uses the a coordinate system that is the
/// transformation applied to its parent coordinate system. The parent
/// coordinate system of a root node is the identity coordinate system.
/// Except when a node is a *skinned mesh* - i.e. it explicitly has a
/// *skin* field and hence also a *mesh* field; then its coordinate system
/// is the identity coordinate system, with the (posed) joints having to
/// provide any mapping of the mesh's coordinates to render coordinates.
///
/// A node *can* be a skinned mesh and a camera and a joint in a skeleton;
/// the spec does not preclude this.
///
/// A Gltf skin defines a collection of nodes as a skeleton; these nodes
/// must have a common ancestor in the node hierarchy (hence they must
/// always be part of the same scene, since each node is part of a single
/// tree and a scene contains trees). Optionally the gltf file specifies
/// some idea of which common ancestor is the 'root' of the skeleton, but
/// this is meaningless if it is not specified to also be a joint.
///
/// A Gltf file allows for a single pose for any one skeleton, as the pose
/// is that specified by the joints that are in the skin. Since a skinned
/// mesh is only positioned (in Gltf) by the positions of the associated
/// joints, a skinned mesh cannot be instantiated into render space at more
/// than one location in a scene.
